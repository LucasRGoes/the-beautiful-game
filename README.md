## Motivation

The Data Engineering and Data Science carreer fields fascinate me since my college student days. After being exposed to their potential i already had an idea of what i wanted to work with after graduation. I believe that personal projects based on personal interests always achieve successful results, and, as most brazilians, i love soccer.

The poor amount of sources of data and statistics of brazilizan football teams and its players can be seen as an opportunity for a challenging project. The main idea is to study the most succesfull teams on our domestic league (Brasileir√£o) since 2003, the first edition of the tournament using a double round-robin system.
